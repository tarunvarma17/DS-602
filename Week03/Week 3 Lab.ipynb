    "#### Supervised learning refers to the branch of machine learning where the training data is fed into the machine with labels, or pre-existing answers. So, the data uses these to learn and make future predictions. In that sense, it is supervised because it has something to learn from past data and better itself. For example, this can be used to estimate the rent of a house given the details about said house\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On the other side, unsupervised learning refers to that type of learning where there are no labels. When we give a model unsupervised data, there is not necessarily a 'right' answer. It just groups the data together in whatever way it thinks is best. For example, this can be used to group together relevant news atricles in a website."

An example of this would be to predict whether someone will pass a class or not. Here the two classes are 'pass the test' and 'fail the test'\n",
